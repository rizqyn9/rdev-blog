# Introduction

```typescript showLineNumbers
import {generate} from 'todo-test-utils'

describe('todo app', () => {
  it('should work for a typical user', () => {
    const user = generate.user()
    // here we're going through the registration process.
    cy.visitApp()
  }
}
```

# Test

This default sizes are added merely for the sake of convenience.

However, you shouldn't choose heading levels because of the font size. You still
have to check the content hierarchy.

For example, if you need larger font size for a normal paragraph, you can't use
h3 because it is not a heading, but you can use p tag with the .h3 class to get
the same result.
